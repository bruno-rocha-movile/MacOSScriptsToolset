# About macOS Scripts Toolset

This is not a project in fact. This is a set of scripts that I use for my own in
order to automate my daily tasks. Some scripts are so specific and depend on a
set of file templates that I use in my company. However, you can download and
adapt them for your needs.

# What is here?

You will find a set of Automator and AppleScript scripts that I use to automate
my daily tasks. There are some services and some standalone scripts that make my
life really easy on macOS.

# License

There is no license. Get it, use it, and be happy. You acknowledge that you will
be using my scripts at your own risk. I do not guarantee anything and it is your
own choice.

Enjoy!
