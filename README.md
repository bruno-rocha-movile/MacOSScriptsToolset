# About this project

In fact this is not a project. It is a flat repository that holds some scripts
that I use in my daily basis for general automation.

I just decided to add this to Github as a public repository in order to share my
tools and, also, to have some version control over it. I have developed a lot of
them, but since they were only small tools, I never took care of it accordingly.
